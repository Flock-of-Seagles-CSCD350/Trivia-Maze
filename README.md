## Working in this Project
Project work should be done by means of **branches** and **pull requests**.

### Branches
Each branch should be dedicated to a user story being worked on in the current iteration. Branch names should be related to the user story name that you're working on.
> For example, the `Question Database Creation` branch could be named `database-creation`

Branches should only contain the new work that the user story is meant to complete. Any content from another user story should be put into another branch.


### Pull Requests
Once the work in each branch is completed, a pull request (PR) should be made towards the current production branch (**not** `master`). By using pull requests, work can be peer-reviewed, which should hopefully create less problems upon merging a PR to the current production branch.

Only create 1 PR for each user story branch. Each commit to the branch is added to the PR even after the PR has been submitted for approval. If there are changes that need to be made before approval, they can be made in the same branch and same PR, which makes it super easy!
